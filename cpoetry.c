The Raven
  Much I marvelled this ungaily fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
  Though its answer little meaning -- little relevancy bore;
  For we cannot help agreeing that no sublunary being
  Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door --
  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
  With such name as Nevermore
